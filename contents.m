% Shark: An Underwater Vehicle Model
% Version 2.1 (R11.1,R12) 20-Dec-2001
% 
% Complete Nonlinear 6DOF Model of an Underwater Vehicle
% 
% 
% PATH :
% 
% add the shark folder to the matlab path, DO NOT 
% add all the subfolders, add only the top folder.
% 
% 
% SIMULATIONS :
% 
% shark;oploop   : Open loop simulation.
% shark;nlksf    : Simple linear attitude control.
% 
% The command "shark" before the name of the simulink
% scheme is meant to automatically select and add the
% right subfolders to the path, and is needed only if
% the two simulations are called from the command line,
% (as opposed to opening the schemes from the Launch 
% Pad or from the demo window).
% 
% BEFORE RUNNING a simulation, double click on the
% "Load Data" block on the top left corner of the 
% simulation scheme to load the required data.
% 
% 
% For additional HELP please read the file 
% "shark.pdf" under the folder shark\doc
